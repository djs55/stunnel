stunnel         Universal SSL tunnel

* High priority features I'm going to support (sponsorship welcomed):
  - Add service-level logging.
  - Optional use of syslog in foreground mode.
  - Provide transparent proxy for Linux 2.6.x with TPROXY patch.

  - In transparent proxy mode bind source port (not only IP).
  - In transparent proxy mode add an option to connect destination address
    of the the original connection instead of a fixed IP list.
  - Modify ./configure to support cross-compilation.

* Low priority features I'm going to support (sponsorship welcomed):
  - Replace protocol.c with a scripting engine.
  - Add some scripting capabilities *after* SSL negotiations.
  - Log file rotation on a signal.
  - Key renegotiation (re-handshake) for long connections.
  - Internationalization of logged messages (i18n).
  - Logging to NT eventlog.
  - IMAP protocol support (RFC 2595).

  - SOCKS 4 protocol support.

  - Graceful configuration reload with a signal on Unix and with GUI on Windows.

* Features I'd prefer NOT to support (waiting for a wealthy sponsor):
  - HTTP protocol support (X-Forwarded-For header).
  - SMTP protocol support (X-Forwarded-For header).
